		Access to healthcare services is critical to good health, yet tribal residents face a variety of access barriers compared to people who live in towns and cities.
		There is a need to bring medical assistance to these under-resourced populations through ongoing mobile medical camps.
		Mobile vans are optimal delivery tools as they can reach all corners of a slum community and can travel the vast distances to support tribal villages. 
		By bringing healthcare to their doorstep, this ensures that the greatest number of patients are served without hindering daily livelihood.</br>
		<br> It is for a health camp being organized in tribal areas and this application will be used by the health workers to register the patients for the camp. These 
		health workers will go from village to village... Talk to the patients and register them. Once the patients are registered these patients will get an SMS with their registration number, 
		date and exact venue of the camp whenever the camp is being organized near their registered location.
